# Wild-Blueberry-Yield-Prediction

The dataset used for predictive modelling was generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Simulation Model, which is an open-source, spatially-explicit computer simulation program, that enables exploration of how various factors, including plant spatial arrangement, outcrossing and self-pollination, bee species compositions and weather conditions, in isolation and combination, affect pollination efficiency and yield of the wild blueberry agro-ecosystem.

In this, an attempt is made to predict the yield of the wild blueberry agro-ecosystem.

The target feature is Yield.

The metric used for evaluation is RMSE
